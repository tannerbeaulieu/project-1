            <h1>About The Company</h1>
            <br>
            <p> The modern day desire to explore the depths of space has commenced astronomical growth in current aerospace technology. Although many private American companies share a similar ambition to probe the unknown, one company in particular initiated the normalization of space travel. In 2002, Elon Musk founded Space Exploration Technologies Corporation, or SpaceX for short, “to revolutionize space technology, with the ultimate goal of enabling people to live on other planets." The company’s advanced redesign of rocket technology, combined with its undeniable eagerness to fulfill the original intention it was built upon, has established an influential reputation in the aerospace sector of society today. SpaceX has made immeasurable headway in space travel since 2002 and will continue to revolutionize aerospace technology in the years to come. 
            </p>
            <p>
            Upon founding the company, Elon Musk knew he wanted to accomplish a couple goals: to make spaceflight routine and affordable, and to make mankind an interplanetary-species. To do so, he needed to exponentially decrease the cost of producing the rockets that make space travel happen. SpaceX achieved a massive milestone when they discovered the idea of making a rocket reusable, rather than a once-and-done type of deal. After nearly a decade of rigorous trial-and-error, in 2012, the company launched its Dragon spacecraft into orbit and successfully recovered it; the first commercial spacecraft to ever do so. The small, private company had already revolutionized the aerospace industry by introducing a reusable rocket, but this was just the beginning. 
            </p>
            <p>
            To launch a rocket into orbit and successfully land it upright is a massive step towards normalizing spaceflight. However, SpaceX still needed to accomplish quite a few more things to reach their goals. First, they must dramatically reduce the cost of producing, launching, and recovering the rocket itself. Unlike other aerospace companies, SpaceX produces nearly 80% of the parts in any SpaceX rocket in their factory in Hawthorne, California. This significantly lowers outsourcing costs, and when producing a multi-million-dollar ship, no cost can be spared. The company focuses on using technological innovations “that allow for each stage of the vehicle deployment to be salvaged and reused; being able to take more payload into space with each trip will make it more affordable than ever. One study, by NASA and the Air Force, estimated that the price tag for going from the initial design stages of the Falcon 9 rocket to its first flight was $440 million, about a third of what it would have cost NASA.”  
            </p>
            <p>
            Before SpaceX introduced modular rockets, rocketry science had not changed much since NASA successfully landed man on the moon and returned the crew safely in 1972. The national aeronautics space association recognized the company’s cutting edge technology and commissioned SpaceX to produce the rockets that would bring astronauts and cargo to the International Space Station; NASA had previously depended on Russia’s more advanced aerospace technologies to safely bring its astronauts to the ISS. This is the first time NASA has outsourced to a private company for rocket production, which says a lot for the rapidly-growing enterprise. However, it is no easy task to be cleared for sending humans into space. The company must have a 96% success rate in rocket launches; to speed up the progress, SpaceX introduced the Block 5, which is “capable of being reused up to 10 times without the need for much refurbishment between launches.” This allowed them to dominate the aerospace industry in terms of launch frequency, in which they launched 21 total flights in 2018. After receiving clearance from NASA to send humans into space in early 2019, SpaceX used its Falcon 9 rocket to successfully send the first astronaut flown from a private American aerospace company to the International Space Station. There are many unbelievers in what the company wants to do, and often their main argument deals with safety. However, it is necessary to take risks when attempting to reach beyond our current doings. “SpaceX supporters say tradition and old ways of thinking can be the enemy of innovation and thwart efforts to open the frontier of space.” 
            </p>
            <p>
            Although reducing the cost of spaceflight is one of the company’s ultimate goals, they still have a plethora of ambitious projects that will utilize the new innovative rocket design. Possibly the most anticipated enterprise for the company is nicknamed Starlink, “a program intended to beam internet coverage to Earth using thousands of satellites moving in synchronized patterns in orbit.” This futuristic project is not far away, in fact, SpaceX has already launched a few test satellites and “received unprecedented approval from the Federal Communications Commission to launch the entire fleet in the years ahead.” This means the company will need to launch 6,000 satellites within the next 6 years to keep the associated licenses; the company is confident they will succeed. Starlink is a project of massive proportions and will require nearly $10 billion in funding, but it is nowhere near their most ambitious project: the development of their biggest rocket, the Starship. Also nicknamed the BFR (big freaking rocket,) the vehicle will be capable of taking groups of people to the moon and even to Mars. The company has already announced the first passenger for the future Starship, meaning commercial spaceflight to the moon is in the near future. As for Mars, the company will have to substantially change the planetary make-up to make it livable for human beings. The process of changing an entire planet is called terraforming, and the company has big plans for Mars. 
            </p>
            <p>
            The Starship and Super Heavy Rocket spaceships will not only be used to bring people to both the moon and Mars, but will also be used for commercial travel. The company is positive they can make any earth-to-earth trip, such as New York to Hong Kong, in under 30 minutes. The ship itself would travel outside of Earth’s atmosphere at vast speeds and safely land on a launch pad on top of the ocean. The benefits of traveling in space include the lack of friction, turbulence, and weather. “SpaceX’s Starship and Super Heavy Rocket represent a fully reusable transportation system designed to service all Earth orbit needs as well as the Moon and Mars. The two-stage vehicle- composed of the Super Heavy rocket (booster) and Starship (ship)- will eventually replace Falcon 9, Falcon Heavy, and Dragon. By creating a single system that can service a variety of markets, SpaceX can redirect resources from Falcon 9, Falcon Heavy, and Dragon to Starship- which is fundamental in making the system affordable.” This form of transportation would dramatically change the current travel industry by allowing any international trip to be completed in under an hour. 
            </p>
            SpaceX has made substantial contribution to the progression of modern-day aerospace technology. The company’s innovative solutions for recycling spaceships, simplifying rocketry science, designing and building parts, and introducing landing pads have allowed the company to normalize spaceflight and make it more affordable, the company’s ultimate goals. SpaceX’s ambition to find futuristic answers to modern-day problems has initiated a search for revolutionary technology. I personally am very confident in the company’s future; they are a truly remarkable corporation and have made impressive advancements in modern-day space technology. The enterprise will continue to surpass expectations and make extensive headway to a truly futuristic society.

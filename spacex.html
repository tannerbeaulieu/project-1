            <h1>About The Company</h1>
            <p>Space Exploration Technologies Corporation, or SpaceX, is a private company that was founded in 2002 by Elon Musk. The company is recognized as the only private company capable of returning a spacecraft from low Earth orbit, which the company accompished with the Dragon rocket in 2010. After this historic milestone, the company was able to use the same spacecraft to deliver cargo to and from the International Space Station in 2012. The company headquarters are located in Hawthorne, California. </p>
            <br>
            <p>Elon Musk created the company with plans to revolutionize the aerospace industry in the hopes of making affordable spaceflight a reality. SpaceX has worked assiduously to reduce the cost of space technology by introducing fully and rapidly resuably rockets. Before the company built the Reusable Launch System, rockets were designed to burn up on reentry. SpaceX rockets are designed to withstand reentry, and return to the launch pad for a vetical landing. The company believes a reusable rocket is the pivotal breakthrough needed to substantially reduce the cost of space access.</p>  
            <br>
            <p>The company is currently using the Falcon family of rockets, which includes the Falcon 9 and the Falcon Heavy, both partially reusable rockets.</p>
